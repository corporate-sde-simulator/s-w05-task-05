# Meeting Notes - Sprint 27 Planning

**Date:**
**Attendees:** Pooja Reddy (Lead), Sneha Jain, Intern

---

## CRM data sync adapter

- **Pooja Reddy:** This is blocking our release. Sneha Jain started the work but got reassigned. @Intern, take this ticket and fix the bugs identified in code review.

- **Sneha Jain:** The core structure is correct but there are two known bugs. Check the PR comments for details. The first issue is the more critical one.

## Action Items

- [ ] @Intern - Fix bugs in `CrmSyncAdapter.java` and `ConflictResolver.java`
- [ ] @Sneha Jain - Code review when PR is ready
- [ ] @Pooja Reddy - Final sign-off before merge
