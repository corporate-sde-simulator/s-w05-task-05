## Decision

Implement CRM data sync adapter using industry-standard patterns appropriate for java and our platform requirements.

- Well-tested approach with known trade-offs

## Consequences

- Must handle edge cases including empty inputs, concurrent access, and error states
- Performance must be monitored after deployment
- Integration tests needed before production rollout
